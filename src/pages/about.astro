                          A former ROM summer staff during her undergraduate degrees, Elizabeth returned to the ROM as a volunteer in October 2024. She provides visitors with hands-on experiences with artifacts and natural history specims. One of her favourite objects is the gauntlet from a suit of armour—especially during the monthly ROM After Dark after hours events. Seeing adults so exicited about putting on the gauntlet is wonderful.

                      </p>
                      <p>Getting into the sprit of Pride is an important part of being a volunteer representative of Pride Toronto. So Elizabeth "glams up" with purple glitter makeup that matches the purple accents on her wheelchair and co-ordinates with the pink volunteer t-shirts. During Pride Toronto 2025 Accessible Media Inc interviewed Elizabeth and featured her (with her festival makeup) in their coverage of the event on YouTube.</p>

Liz designed the <a href="/graphic-design/#pubscript-graphic">PubScript logo and promo materials</a>  in Figma using the London UK Tube roundals as inspiration. She was invited to start the Accessibilty Team and the Volunteer Team before moving on to her position at the ROM.
