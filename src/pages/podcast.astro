                About Liz McCready, Host of Curb Cuts and Conversations
                
                In addition to undergraduate and postgraduate courses in urban planning, Liz has lived and professional experience in disability advocacy and accessibility:
                
                She's a wheelchair user with hypermobility, hearing loss, and a recovered ptsd survivor
                Her mom is legally blind, so Liz grew up being a "seeing guide daughter"
                For 18 years she worked privately with students with invisible disabilities, neurodivergence, and giftedness in k-12 and postsecondary.
                Liz is a recuse cat mom to Boo and Maybel, an addicted knitter, and a volunteer with over 15,000 volunteer hours. In January, 2025 she started project management and advanced marketing certificates at the University of Toronto.
