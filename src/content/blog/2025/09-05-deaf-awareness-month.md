**WORKING DRAFT!**
### Storytime of ...

The summer I started teaching I worked at an outdoor education centre in the Rocky Mountains. On the application form were the usual things you’d you’d expect to find:​

- Do you have Standard First Aid and CPR, or Wilderness First Aid?
- What is your level of lifeguarding certification? ​
- Do you have rock climbing experience?
- Do you have canoeing certifications? ​
    
... and then there was what is your level of ASL American Sign Language?​​
    

You see, years before I worked there, the outdoor ed centre would run a one week Deaf camp at the smaller of the two lodges. Deaf kids, hard of hearing (HOH) kids, and those who are CODAs (children of deaf adults) whose first language was American Sign Language would come to spend a week in a fun environment where almost everyone spoke ASL and/or signed English.​

Because campers at both the small and big lodges would mix and share activities, some ASL started to become part of the culture for the kids and teens. And what do kids learn first from each other? How to say the bad words in a language that not all the adults know!​  
So within a few years learning some basic signed English and ASL phrases became part of staff training for everyone. There was even a session on “swearing in ASL”, but also we learned to sing songs in sign language, how to deal with Grizzly bears and Deaf kids, teach canoeing to campers who were Deaf and hard of hearing, and about Deaf culture.​  
​
As more staff took their ASL certifications, and learned ASL in staff training it became part of the adult staff culture too. Some basic signs came in handy communicating over a group of loud kids across a big field. ASL was also very handy on nights off in loud bars and music gigs in Canmore and Banff.​
​  
By the time I started, there wasn’t a separate Deaf camp session. It was just part of Centre’s mindset and the culture.​ 

Having an accessibility first mindset and culture benefited everyone – not just the Deaf, hard of hearing and CODA kids.​

### Resources by Deaf and CODA Creators

Though I have some hearing loss and tinnitus, and used to be functionally fluent in ASL, I'm not Deaf/deaf, Hard of Hearing, or CODA (Child of a Deaf Adult). So, instead of writing my own take on Deaf Culture and ASL 101 I'm sharing some curated resources by Deaf and CODA.
